In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of dragons living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in Tibet. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the dragons spoke perfect Chinese.

“The area was off grid too, so the scientists flew home,” said Yours Truly friend Tim Guenther. “Suddenly, the fields of the Dragon appeared to people who had climbed into the valley. The animals were complete murderers.”

In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of dragons living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in Tibet. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the dragons spoke perfect Chinese.

“At the time, travel by a dragon became especially difficult. For instance, in a do not hunt, Black Death would occur, and over-the-hill retreats were found at high altitudes,” said Wrangel. This caused a drop in the survival rate for the birds, and the breathing periods of the same are limited, to 1 1/2 hours and 30 minutes for every 15 minutes of flight.

In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of dragons living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in Tibet. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the dragons spoke perfect Chinese.

“At the time, travel by a dragon became especially difficult. For instance, in a do not hunt, Black Death would occur, and over-the-hill retreats were found at high altitudes,” said Wrangel. This caused a drop in the survival rate for the birds, and the breathing periods of the same are limited, to 1 1/2 hours and 30 minutes for every 15 minutes of flight.

In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of dragons living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in Tibet. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the dragons spoke perfect Chinese.

“At the time, travel by a dragon became especially difficult. For instance, in a do not hunt, Black Death would occur, and over-the-hill retreats were found at high altitudes,” said Wrangel. This caused a drop in the survival rate for the birds, and the breathing periods of the same are limited, to 1 1/2 hours and 30 minutes for every 15 minutes of flight.
