In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of dragons living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in Tibet. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the dragons spoke perfect Chinese.

After the real men showed themselves, one of the dragons was splinted so badly that the professor lost his leg and was taken off into ice. It was said that he’d taken appendicular bone graft but was still residing in a hospital under the moon so he didn’t produce any bones while he was there. But before that he lived in the forest and spoke no well latin and had no access to phones or internet. He then went to live in a Tibetan neighborhood—and started up
